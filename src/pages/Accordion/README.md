- When you want to coordinate two components, move their state to their common parent.
- Then pass the information down through props from their common parent.
- Finally, pass the event handlers down so that the children can change the parentâ€™s state.

**Summary:**

- `useState` with an object
- How to update an state object
- How to show/hide div element without CSS

```js
const [section, setSection] = useState({
  html: false,
  css: false,
  js: false,
});
setSection((prev) => ({
  ...prev,
  [section]: !prev[section],
})
{section['html'] && (<div>a</div>)}
```

## useState with an object

```js
// useState with an object
const [openSection, setOpenSection] = useState({
  html: false,
  css: false,
  js: false,
});
// How to update an state object
const handleClick = (section) => {
  setOpenSection((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    [section]: !prev[section],
  }));
};
// How to show/hide div element without CSS
{
  section['css'] && <div>a</div>;
